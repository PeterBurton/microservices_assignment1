                I'm using TextBlob for the sentiment analysis side of things. TextBlob is a Python library for processing text data. It provides a 
                simple API for performing common NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                TextBlob assigns sentiment polarity scores between -1 to +1. The closer to -1 a score is, the more negative it is. The closer to 
                +1 a score is, the more positive it is. A score of 0 means the tweet was classified as neutral.
            </h3>

                This result is the average of scores taken from the for the last minute, rounded to 2 decimal places.
